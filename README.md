# Snake Game Project
My project for the Introduction to Functional Programming and Scala Language course
## Tasks:
1. Create the Project Description
1. Implement such Project
## Project Description:
It's a classical snake game written on the Scala language
### Technologies:
* Scala
* Scala.swing (for GUI)
### Game rules:
* The player is the snake
* The goal is to eat as many apples as you can
* Bumping into the wall or tail leads to death
* If you died, there are two chairs:
    1. Restart the game
    1. Continue from the death moment (for casuals)
## How to run:
1. Download the project
1. Open SnakeGame.game.src.main.scala.vyacheslav.vasilev.GameUI

## How to play:
1. Press arrows on your keyboard to direct the snake
1. Press the "Space" button if you want to pause the game
1. There are 2 buttons. You may click on them
1. If the game is on pause, you still can change the snake's direction 
## How to test:
1. Open sbt shell
1. Write "test"
1. Probably, it doesn't work, so run them by hands. 
You may find them at SnakeGame.game.src.test.scala.vyacheslav.vasilev
